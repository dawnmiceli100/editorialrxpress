The book shares rich personal stories of a group of exceptional women who suffered and overcame rigorous hardships, incomprehensible loss and numbing tragedies to create dynamic legacies. These women's collective contributions and impact on their contemporaries and future generations demonstrate that anyone is capable of great things, regardless of gender, race, or any other personal attribute that falls outside the culturally perceived "norm."

Whether you just want to be entertained by stories of heroic women who lived in another epoch, or be inspired by an iconoclastic group of gritty pioneer women, you will find it here in <em>Female Pioneers of Fort Myers</em>.
