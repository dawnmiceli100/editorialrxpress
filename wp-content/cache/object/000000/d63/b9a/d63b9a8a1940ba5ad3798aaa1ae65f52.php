Also told are first-hand accounts of the devastation of the hurricanes of 1928 and 1949.

Framed from the perspective of today by her granddaughter, Patricia Winne Adams, who edits this personal account, ‚ÄúGertie‚Äù graphically portrays the details of living near Lake Okeechobee in the Everglades without benefit of conveniences other than her own skills and perseverance.

This is the story of a mother making a life for her children and family on Torry Island in Lake Okeechobee in circumstances of great beauty and personal challenge. It is the story of a southern Florida as it once was and never will be again. It is the story of great love, daily accomplishments, and a life self-made.

The observations and pioneering voice provided in <em>Memoirs of an Everglade Pionee</em>r distinguishes this book as a new and vivid resource for those interested in biography, adventure, and Florida history.
