<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About the Author</span></h4>
C. T. Flynn is a physician whose professional life has been spent in the scientific application of artificial organs to the worthwhile extension of life for sufferers from life-threatening organ failure. Without the science no effective measures can be found. Without a society able and willing to support such science, nothing can be put into practice. Without a sense of the worth of human existence, without love, without compassion, the application of science would be meaningless. As Spinoza said, ‚ÄúBut all noble things are as difficult as they are rare.‚Äù Now happily retired from the fray, the author has pondered on his own experiences and how to make spiritual sense of it all.";s:10:"post_title";s:53:"Evolving Medical Ethics and Justice by C.T.
